"""Refuse a commit subject that is not in the imperative.

`committed` has an `imperative_subject` setting, and it fires only on a
lowercase first word. The same configuration requires the subject to be
capitalised, so its rule can never fire; and even lowercase it misses
"bumped", "refactored", "wrote" and "made". The setting is kept true so the
intent is recorded, and this is what enforces it.

    python scripts/imperative.py origin/main..HEAD
    python scripts/imperative.py --all
    python scripts/imperative.py --file .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG

The second form is what the commit-msg hook uses, so a subject is refused
while it is being written rather than in CI afterwards.

The rule: the subject completes the sentence "if applied, this commit will
...". That test is Chris Beams' (2014), not git's; git's own SubmittingPatches
asks for the imperative without offering a test for it. So "Add the check",
never "Added", "Adds" or "Adding". Exit 1 names every subject that fails.
