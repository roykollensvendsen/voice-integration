# Contributing

Every rule this repository states is enforced by something that can fail. If
you find a rule here with no mechanism behind it, that is a bug worth
reporting.

## Set up

<!-- not run: clones the repository the reader is already in -->
```
git clone https://github.com/roykollensvendsen/voice-integration
cd voice-integration
uv sync --all-extras
```

The commit linter is a separate binary,
[committed](https://github.com/crate-ci/committed).

## The gates

All of these run in CI on every pull request. Run them before you push,
because they are the same lines:

<!-- not run: these are the gates; running them from inside a gate would recurse -->
```
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest -q --cov
uv run voicebridge check .
committed --no-merge-commit origin/main..HEAD
```

Run them after the last edit, not before it. A file edited after the format
gate ran will fail in continuous integration, which is the cheapest possible
way to learn that the gates are not a ritual performed once.

## How a change is made

1. **Decide before you build.** A choice that costs more to reverse than to
   take is written as a record under `decisions/` before the code, in the form
   [`decisions/README.md`](decisions/README.md) gives.
2. **Say it before you build it.** A rule, a flag or a field is written down
   before it is code. If the documentation does not say it, it is not decided.
3. **Write a test and watch it fail.** A test that passes on its first run
   proves nothing. Where the rule already exists and no test can precede it,
   turn the rule off with `python scripts/mutate.py`, watch a named test go
   red, and keep the row in `scripts/mutations.toml`.
4. **Write the smallest code that turns it green**, then refactor with the
   suite green.
5. **Open one pull request per change**, with the template's checklist
   answered. The template is the mechanism for the rules no script can measure.

`main` is protected: a pull request is required, every status check has to pass,
force pushes and deletions are refused, history stays linear, and none of it is
waived for administrators. That is a repository setting rather than a test,
because a test that proves it would need a credential to pass and would fail for
the wrong reasons. It is the one rule here enforced by something the suite
cannot see, and [`decisions/ADR-VI-015`](decisions/ADR-VI-015-public-so-the-pull-request-rule-has-a-mechanism.md)
says why the repository is public so that it could exist at all.

A pull request lands by rebase, and by nothing else. Every commit on a branch
therefore arrives on `main` individually, so write each one to stand alone:
green, lintable, and readable from `git blame` without the others. A branch
cannot be tidied at the end by squashing it, which is why `committed.toml`
refuses a fixup and a work-in-progress commit rather than trusting you to clean
up later. The reasoning is
[`decisions/ADR-VI-016`](decisions/ADR-VI-016-rebase-merges-only.md).

## Documents that restate a fact

Point rather than copy. Where a document has to copy anyway, two test files
keep the copy honest. Any block fenced as ` ```console ` is run by
`tests/test_documented_commands.py`, and its output has to match what the page
shows. Pages are found by walking rather than listed, so a new one is covered
the day it is written; a block that looks like commands and is not run must
carry `<!-- not run: why -->` above it, because choosing another fence would
otherwise be an opt-out nobody sees.

`tests/test_documentation.py` checks the facts that are not commands: the
gates above against the workflow that must run them, and every deferred item
against its trigger. Add a test there whenever you write a fact into prose
that also lives in code.

## When something bites you

Write the lesson where the next person doing this task will read it, in the
same pull request as the fix. Where the mistake is checkable, make it a test or
a check rather than prose: prose gets skipped under the same pressure that
crowds out learning in the first place, and a failing test does not.

This is the one pattern with a measured effect behind it. A surgical checklist
run during the operation, rather than a lesson filed after it, halved the death
rate across eight hospitals. The incident-review literature diagnoses the
failure from the other side, naming the lesson nobody wired back to anything an
"orphan action item". The reasoning and its sources are in
[`references/learning-from-experience.md`](references/learning-from-experience.md).

Attach it to the step it belongs to, as a sentence in that step. Not a section
of its own, and never a "gotchas" heading: that is a drawer things are filed in
rather than read from. A lesson with no step to attach to does not belong in
that skill, and the absence is the signal that it belongs in another one. One
line in the skill, and the detail in `references/` if it needs more.

A lesson written into a skill keeps its provenance in `git blame`, not in the
text: point at the line, get the commit, get the story. Never write a commit
hash into a skill. It duplicates what blame already gives, it dates the
guidance, and the commit that records a lesson cannot cite itself.

What blame does not give is a corpus. It answers why one line says what it
says, and never which lessons have gone stale, which contradict each other, or
which step has none. That is what a knowledge base is for, and
[`decisions/deferred.md`](decisions/deferred.md) says what would make building
one worth it.

There is no retrospective ritual here on purpose. Every source measuring one
is about information flowing between people in a team, which has no referent
when the team is one person and their agents.

## Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), checked by
`committed.toml`: one line, `type: Subject`, at most 72 characters,
capitalised after the type, no full stop. Types are build, chore, ci, docs,
feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style and test. Keep body lines at or under
100 characters. Say why the change was made, not what the diff already shows.

Write the subject in the imperative: it completes "if applied, this commit
will ...". So "Add the check", never "Added", "Adds", "Adding", and never a
noun phrase like "A new check". The linter has a setting for this, and it fires only on a lowercase first
word while the same configuration requires a capital, so it can never fire;
`scripts/imperative.py` is what refuses it.

A `commit-msg` hook runs both while you are writing the message, rather than
in CI afterwards. Turn it on once per clone:

<!-- not run: it is already on in this clone -->
```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

It is a convenience and not the gate: `--no-verify` skips it, and CI is what
actually blocks.

The hook also warns when a body is harder to read than it needs to be:
sentences over thirty words, an average over twenty, a body far past eighty
words. It only warns. How long a sentence needs to be is a judgement, and a
gate that refuses a message nobody can shorten teaches people to bypass it.
