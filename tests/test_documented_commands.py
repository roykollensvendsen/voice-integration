"""Run the commands the documentation shows, and compare what they print.

The maintained plugins for testing markdown run a block and check that it
exited zero; none of them compares the output a document puts in front of a
reader, which is the part that goes wrong silently. This extractor is forty
lines and has no dependency, so it is written here rather than reached for.

A block fenced as ``console`` is run. Lines beginning ``$ `` are commands, and
everything until the next command is what the document says they print.

There is no silent way out. A block that looks like commands and is not
fenced ``console`` must carry ``<!-- not run: <reason> -->`` on the line
above, or the suite fails; choosing a different fence is otherwise an opt-out
nobody sees. Every verb the command has must appear in at least one block that
is run, so a verb cannot be added without a worked example.
