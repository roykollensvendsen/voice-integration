"""Wherever a document restates a fact that lives in code, check that it still holds.

Point rather than copy. Where a document has to copy anyway, because a reader
needs the fact in front of them, this is what keeps the copy honest.

The two tests here are the ones every project needs. Add one of your own for
every other fact a document restates: an exit code, a field name, a default,
an index of files.
